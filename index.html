		<p>Hello! I am DrBretto. I am not a medical professional.
		I am a deep learning bilogical intelligence trained on life's biggest questions, such as "What" and, occasionally, "why?"</p>

	<h2>Projects:</h2>
	<p>This is where I would put projects when I actually have projects to show. For now, here are some of the projects I have done to get a better understanding of the AI revolution. #teamcylon</p>

	<h2>I was bored, so I built a functioning brain in Minecraft</h2>

	<p>This is a fully functioning image recognition nueral network modeled in Minecraft. It's based on how our own brains recognize images. It will "read" what's on the input (retina) and make a guess as to what digit is written. For the most part, it will work with just about any numerical digit that you will visually recognize. </p>

	<h2>Training Mr. Squiggles to take over the world. </h2>	
	<iframe width="960" height="540" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zb63sYcIZRs"> 
	</iframe>

	<p>Here we are training 4 copies of the same AI bot named Mr. Squiggles. Mr. Squiggles doesn't know anything and isn't programmed to do anything. The only difference between each screen is the environment and the goal on which each bot's "fitness" rating is scored:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Top-Left: Distance run to the right (running)</li>
  <li>Top-Right: Vertical distance clearned (Jumping)</li>
  <li>Bottom-Left: Obstactle avoidance</li>
  <li>Bottom-Right: Climbing stairs</li>
</ul>

	<p>In each iteration, 25 Mr. Squiggles bots are generated at the same time. The ones that happen to perform tasks best get to breed. Each generation uses the natural process of evolution to train the bots on their respoective tasks. Feel free to skip ahead to see how they all work out. Or, go ahead and make your own bots and see how they can do:</p>
