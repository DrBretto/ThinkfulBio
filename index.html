        <main>
            <p>Hello! I am DrBretto. I am a deep learning bilogical intelligence trained on life's biggest questions, such as "What" and, occasionally, "why?". I reside in the great state of New Hampshire. I will fill this in with more relevant information
                as we go along. Clearly, I am a developer and not a designer. I will add more and more to this as time goes on but for right now, there's not much to show.</p>

        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <p>This is where I would put projects when I actually have projects to show. For now, here are some of the projects I have done to get a better understanding of the AI revolution. (#teamCylon)</p>

                <!-- First video -->
                <h3>I was bored, so I built a functioning brain in Minecraft</h3>

                <!-- I assume we will make this responsive later, but for now I just formatted it for my screen-->

                <p>This is a fully functioning image recognition neural network modeled in Minecraft. It's based on how our own brains recognize images. It will "read" what's on the input (retina) and make a guess as to which digit is written. For the most
                    part, it will work with just about any numerical digit that you will visually recognize.</p>
                <p>Reverse engineered from <a href="https://github.com/celiasmith/mind_field_stilwell_brain">this
							source code</a> and originaly written for an episode of YouTube Premium's MindField.</p>

                <h3>Training Mr. Squiggles to take over the world. </h3>
                <iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zb63sYcIZRs">
					</iframe>
                <!-- same as above, I am basing the dimensions on how it looks on my screen but will likely make dynamic by the end of the class-->

                <p>Here we are training 4 copies of the same AI bot named Mr. Squiggles. Mr. Squiggles doesn't know anything and isn't programmed to do anything. The only difference between each screen is the environment and the goal on which each bot's
                    "fitness" rating is scored:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Top-Left: Distance run to the right (running)</li>
                    <li>Top-Right: Vertical distance clearned (Jumping)</li>
                    <li>Bottom-Left: Obstactle avoidance</li>
                    <li>Bottom-Right: Climbing stairs</li>
                </ol>
                <!-- This is not normally content that would require an ordered list, but I have included it here to meet requirements-->

                <p>In each iteration, 25 Mr. Squiggles bots are generated at the same time (the best one is highlighted). The bots that perform their tasks the best (ie, the "fittest") get to breed. Each new generation, usually, gets a little bit more evolved
                    at soliving their task. This is meant to help visualize what's going on with more robust AI neural networks.</p>
                <p> Feel free to skip ahead to see how they all work out. Or, go ahead and make your own bots and see what they can do for yourself!</p>
